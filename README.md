# active-notification-framework
The active-notification-framework is a framework managing notifications on multiple registered devices (phone,watch,...) based on activity, location and behaviour. 

Notifications will get different signal depending on their importance and the context of the user. In the first versions the channels phone and watch are used to create a better user experience for a user with notifications.

The framework is a result of a master's thesis that was made for the university of applied science in Offenburg and the Fiducia & GAD IT AG.

## Development status and further development
This is the first Version. The current status of the code corresponds to the status immediately after the master's thesis. In the next iterations the project will be made more productive and easy to use. 

At the moment android smartphones and android wear smart watches are supported.
